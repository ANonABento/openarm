# OpenArm
A fully open-source robot arm project

# Overview
This repository outlines all the necessary materials and software repositories required in order to build, setup, and deploy OpenArm. These are outlined in the [`Hardware`]() and [`Software`]() sections. In addition this, this repository also provides sample code to assist with robot simulation setup in Genesis and Gazebo environments. Finally, there is example code for tele-operation with bilateral feedback implementation. Directions the setup for these features are detailed in the [`Simulation`]() and [`Teleoperation`]() sections.
