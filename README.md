# OpenArm: A fully open-source robot arm project

This repository outlines all the necessary materials and software required in order to build, setup, and deploy OpenArm. These are outlined in the [Hardware](#Hardware) and [Software](#Software) sections. In addition this, this repository also provides examples to assist with robot simulation setup in Genesis and Gazebo environments. Finally, there is support for tele-operation with bilateral feedback implementation. Directions to the setup for these features are detailed in the [Simulation](#Simulation) and [Teleoperation](#Teleoperation) sections.

## üõ†Ô∏èHardware

The CAD for the OpenArm v1 project can be accessed on OnShape through the following link: 
- [CAD overview]()
(CAD image would be good here)

With the philosophy of being able to source all components through the popular marketplace Misumi and its manufacturing service Meviy, we provide a Bill of Materials required for assembling the OpenArm v1. This is merely an example ‚Äî similar services worldwide can also be used to procure the necessary components.

We provide this assembly guide as a reference for assembling the OpenArm v1. It outlines the necessary steps and components to help ensure a smooth assembly process.

## üíæSoftware
OpenArm‚Äôs software stack includes real-time motor control examples, enabling users to quickly set up and start moving the arm. It also provides motor calibration tools, a SocketCAN driver, and a step-by-step tutorials on setting up the CAN interface.

## ü§ñSimulation
To get started with setting up OpenArm in simulation environments, an example tutorial of the arm in Genesis is provided. Support for other preferred sim environments such as MuJuCo, MoveIt, and Gazebo are also present.
- Genesis Tutorial/Examples
- Support for MuJuCo, MoveIt, Gazebo

## üèóÔ∏èTeleoperation
To configure one set of OpenArms to act in teleoperation, the setup is provided in the Unilateral and Bilateral links.
- Unilateral Control
- Bilateral Control (If implemented in time)
