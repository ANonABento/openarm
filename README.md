# OpenArm: A fully open-source robot arm project

This repository outlines all the necessary materials and software repositories required in order to build, setup, and deploy OpenArm. These are outlined in the [Hardware](#Hardware) and [Software](#Software) sections. In addition this, this repository also provides sample code to assist with robot simulation setup in Genesis and Gazebo environments. Finally, there is example code for tele-operation with bilateral feedback implementation. Directions the setup for these features are detailed in the [Simulation](#Simulation) and [Teleoperation](#Teleoperation) sections.

## üõ†Ô∏èHardware

The CAD for the OpenArm v1 project can be accessed on OnShape through the following link: 
- Provide CAD overview

With the philosophy of sourcing all components through the popular marketplace Misumi and its manufacturing service Meviy, we provide a Bill of Materials required for assembling the OpenArm v1. This is merely an example‚Äîsimilar services can also be used to procure the necessary components.
