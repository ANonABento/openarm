# OpenArm: A fully open-source robot arm project
This repository outlines all the necessary materials and software repositories required in order to build, setup, and deploy OpenArm. These are outlined in the [Hardware](#Hardware) and [Software](#Software) sections. In addition this, this repository also provides sample code to assist with robot simulation setup in Genesis and Gazebo environments. Finally, there is example code for tele-operation with bilateral feedback implementation. Directions the setup for these features are detailed in the [Simulation](#Simulation) and [Teleoperation](#Teleoperation) sections.
