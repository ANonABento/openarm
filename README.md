# OpenArm
A fully open-source robot arm project

# Overview
This repository outlines all the necessary materials and software repositories required in order to build, setup, and deploy OpenArm. These are outlined in the [Hardware](#ssHardware) and [Software](#ssSoftware) sections. In addition this, this repository also provides sample code to assist with robot simulation setup in Genesis and Gazebo environments. Finally, there is example code for tele-operation with bilateral feedback implementation. Directions the setup for these features are detailed in the [Simulation](#ssSimulation) and [Teleoperation](#ssTeleoperation) sections.
